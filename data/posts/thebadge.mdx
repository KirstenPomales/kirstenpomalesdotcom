**About [IEEE P2145 Working Group on Blcockahin/DLT Governance](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ieee2145/)**  
Blockchain / DLT Governance is a complex topic. The topic is made more difficult by a lack of a shared language. The IEEE P2145 Working Group exists to identify and share a common vocabulary for discussing the governance of shared ledgers, and to eventually draft standards for DLT governance activities (a Process Model), and possibly for defining the maturity of a governance regime (a Maturity Model).  
  
P2145 actively seeks participation from individuals plus other standards organizations, blockchain ecosystems, consortia, and other entities in pursuit of our holistic and collaborative approach to standards development. If you represent an organization with an interest in DLT governance standards, please connect with us [through our website.](https://sagroups.ieee.org/ieee2145/).
