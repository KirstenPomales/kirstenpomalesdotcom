# How One Open-Source Contributor Saved TheBadge‚Äôs Launch Day

##### A BuilderPlace Case Study

# The emergency

It was 8:34 AM CET on Friday, December 1st when I got a message from  [Agu](https://twitter.com/Agupane), my friend and COO of  [TheBadge](https://www.thebadge.xyz/)  ‚Äî a decentralized certification protocol.

They were 3 days away from launching ‚Äúblockchain certifications as a service‚Äù to mainnet when they came across a ü™≤  **bug that was preventing their subgraph from deploying on Polygon**.

ü§Ø  **This was a big issue**. One of their clients needed their certifications as a service to issue credentials on Monday, December 4th!

They reached out to The Graph team for help. Their developers diligently checked the issue, but didn‚Äôt have immediate solutions.  [The Graph team created an ticket on Github](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/5035), to ask the community for help.

TheBadge‚Äôs team had been working all night to figure out the issue, but couldn‚Äôt solve it. So, they asked our help to launch an üö®  **emergency bug bounty**  üö® on  [BuilderPlace](https://builder.place/)  ‚Äî an open-source bounty management platform that just launched on  [TalentLayer](https://docs.talentlayer.org/).

# The bounty

TheBadge team is participating in BuilderPlace Alpha cohort. This bug turned out to be the most important first bounty to post on their community portal  [**thebadge.builder.place**](http://thebadge.builder.place/)**.**

TheBadge‚Äôs BuilderPlace bounty board

By 11:00 AM CET, the bounty post went live on BuilderPlace.

The bounty post automatically got distributed to other hiring platforms like  [WorkX](https://workx.io/); that‚Äôs because BuilderPlace is integrated with  [TalentLayer; an API that connects marketplaces](https://docs.talentlayer.org/).

We posted the bounty in a bunch of smart contract auditor Telegram groups and Discords ‚Äî and, of course, Twitter!

These channels resulted in 8 open-source auditors joining  [TheBadge‚Äôs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FTxtkgbAC4)  in the following few hours. @Codingsh was one of them! He found the emergency bug via Kirsten‚Äôs Twitter post.

TheBadge‚Äôs team explained the issue in detail on their Discord #bounty-hunters channel and in  [this Notion guide](https://www.notion.so/Emergency-Bug-Bounty-9f51733fe88540ccb5b6fbe4f7cdcc93?pvs=21).

The description of the issue on TheBadge‚Äôs Discord

People started to review the code and come up with possible explanations for the issue. ü§î

Some possible explanations (that didn‚Äôt solve the issue)

Different ideas were discussed and tested, but none solved the issue.

By the end of the day Sunday, there was still no resolution to be found. TheBadge team was figuring out backup plans.

# The solution

On Monday, December 4th ‚Äî the day the mainnet launch was schedule for, and the day that TheBadge‚Äôs first client needed to use their certifications ‚Äî a message came into the Discord at 5:09 AM CET.

The post from CodingSH proposing a solution (that worked!)

@Codingsh proposed a solution. Agu ended up checking it, and it indeed resolved the deployment issue!

TheBadge was able to deploy their subgraph on Polygon ‚Äî just in time.

# What was the issue?

It turned out in the end that there was not an issue with TheBadge‚Äôs code itself ‚Äî after all, they were able to deploy their contracts and subgraphs successfully to multiple other chains, just couldn‚Äôt deploy to Polygon.

The version of TheGraph CLI that TheBadge was using to deploy had a bug relating to the RPC provider it used on Polygon. Updating the CLI solved the problem.

Sometimes the most simple bugs cause the most issues ‚Äî oftentimes they‚Äôre hard to diagnose; especially when hidden behind multiple layers of dependencies like this one.

[In this thread](https://twitter.com/codingsh/status/1738008073493766617), Codingsh gave an overview of how he approached the issue.

TheBadge‚Äôs team reported back to The Graph team that they‚Äôd solved the issue! The case of the mystery failed subgraph deployment was solved.

Agu reporting back to The Graph that the issue was solved

Thanks to @Codingsh TheBadge was able to launch on mainnet on-time.

TheBadge‚Äôs team was incredible grateful for his help, and awarded him the bounty of 500 USDC through BuilderPlace.

# The power of open-source

By simply sharing the things we need help with in public, and sharing the mission behind what you are doing, we can achieve so much more than we could alone.

Whether we‚Äôre talking about solving pressing emergency bugs or even just building new features for your ecosystem ‚Äî there are people our there that want to help you today.

The reason I‚Äôm so excited about the launch of BuilderPlace is because it gives every team the power to engage open-source contributors towards their project‚Äôs goals.

I‚Äôve seen it first-hand at TalentLayer ‚Äî we wouldn‚Äôt be where we are today without contributions of 25+ open-source developers, marketers, and researchers.

We were so happy to see TheBadge have so much success with their first ever open-source contribution! They‚Äôve already posted two more since then.

Are you an open-source developer looking to have an impact?

Are you an open-source project looking to expand?

Check out  [BuilderPlace](https://builder.place/)  today. It may be just the tool you‚Äôve been looking for.
